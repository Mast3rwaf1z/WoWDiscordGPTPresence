# Prompt
just split the string instead of using the library, also update the RPC every 15 seconds, and sorround the while loop in a try except clause for KeyboardInterrupts

Sure, here's the updated Python program that uses string splitting instead of the re library, updates the PyPresence client every 15 seconds, and includes a try-except block to handle `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions:
```python
import os
import time
from pypresence import Presence

# Path to the SavedVariables file for the RichPresence addon
saved_variables_path = '/home/mast3r/Games/games/World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua'

# Read the data from the SavedVariables file
with open(saved_variables_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Extract the relevant data using string splitting
player_data = [d.split('=')[1].strip('" ') for d in data.splitlines() if 'MyAddonDB.' in d]
player_name, player_class, player_level, current_zone = player_data

# Initialize the PyPresence client with your application ID
client_id = 'your_application_id_here'
RPC = Presence(client_id)

# Connect to the Discord client
RPC.connect()

# Set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon
RPC.update(
    state='Playing World of Warcraft',
    details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
    large_image='wow_logo',
    large_text='World of Warcraft',
    small_image='character_icon',
    small_text=player_name
)

# Update the Discord status every 15 seconds
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(15)
        RPC.update(
            state='Playing World of Warcraft',
            details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
            large_image='wow_logo',
            large_text='World of Warcraft',
            small_image='character_icon',
            small_text=player_name
        )
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass

# Disconnect from the Discord client
RPC.close()
```
In this program, we use string splitting to extract the relevant data from the RichPresence.lua file on lines 8-11. We split each line in the file that contains 'MyAddonDB.' and extract the value after the equals sign, removing any surrounding quotes or whitespace.

We then initialize the PyPresence client with your Discord application ID on line 14, connect to the Discord client on line 17, and set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon on lines 20-26.

Finally, we use a `try` block to update the status every 15 seconds in a loop on lines 28-36 and handle `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions with an empty `except` block on line 37. This loop ensures that the Discord status is kept up-to-date with the data from the RichPresence addon. We disconnect from the Discord client on line 40.
