# Prompt
that was not the point, go into the code above my previous prompt and replace the strings and only the strings in that code
# Reply
Apologies for the confusion. Here's the updated Python code that only replaces the string `" "` with `","` in the previous code snippet:
```python
import os
import time
from pypresence import Presence

# Path to the SavedVariables file for the RichPresence addon
saved_variables_path = '/home/mast3r/Games/games/World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua'

# Read the data from the SavedVariables file
with open(saved_variables_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Extract the relevant data using string splitting
player_data = [d.split('=')[1].replace('" ', '","') for d in data.splitlines() if 'MyAddonDB.' in d]
player_name, player_class, player_level, current_zone = player_data

# Initialize the PyPresence client with your application ID
client_id = 'your_application_id_here'
RPC = Presence(client_id)

# Connect to the Discord client
RPC.connect()

# Set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon
RPC.update(
    state='Playing World of Warcraft',
    details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
    large_image='wow_logo',
    large_text='World of Warcraft',
    small_image='character_icon',
    small_text=player_name
)

# Update the Discord status every 15 seconds
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(15)
        RPC.update(
            state='Playing World of Warcraft',
            details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
            large_image='wow_logo',
            large_text='World of Warcraft',
            small_image='character_icon',
            small_text=player_name
        )
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass

# Disconnect from the Discord client
RPC.close()
```
The only change I made was to replace " " with "," in the player_data list comprehension on line 13. This should correctly split each data value into separate strings.
