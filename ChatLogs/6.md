I see. If the data in the RichPresence.lua file is not in JSON format, we'll need to modify the program to extract the relevant data from the file directly. Here's an updated Python program that reads the file and sets the Discord status using the extracted data:
```python
import os
import re
import time
from pypresence import Presence

# Path to the SavedVariables file for the RichPresence addon
saved_variables_path = '/home/mast3r/Games/games/World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua'

# Open the SavedVariables file and extract the relevant data
with open(saved_variables_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
    # Extract the player's name
    name_match = re.search(r'MyAddonDB\.name\s*=\s*"(?P<name>[^"]+)"', data)
    player_name = name_match.group('name') if name_match else None
    # Extract the player's class
    class_match = re.search(r'MyAddonDB\.class\s*=\s*"(?P<class>[^"]+)"', data)
    player_class = class_match.group('class') if class_match else None
    # Extract the player's level
    level_match = re.search(r'MyAddonDB\.level\s*=\s*(?P<level>\d+)', data)
    player_level = int(level_match.group('level')) if level_match else None
    # Extract the current zone
    zone_match = re.search(r'MyAddonDB\.zone\s*=\s*"(?P<zone>[^"]+)"', data)
    current_zone = zone_match.group('zone') if zone_match else None

# Initialize the PyPresence client with your application ID
client_id = 'your_application_id_here'
RPC = Presence(client_id)

# Connect to the Discord client
RPC.connect()

# Set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon
if player_name and player_class and player_level and current_zone:
    RPC.update(
        state='Playing World of Warcraft',
        details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
        large_image='wow_logo',
        large_text='World of Warcraft',
        small_image='character_icon',
        small_text=player_name
    )

# Wait for the program to end or for the connection to be lost
while True:
    time.sleep(15)
    if not RPC.connected:
        break
```
In this program, we use regular expressions to extract the relevant data from the RichPresence.lua file on lines 10-23. We search for the lines in the file that contain the player's name, class, level, and current zone and extract the corresponding values.

We then initialize the PyPresence client with your Discord application ID on line 26, connect to the Discord client on line 29, and set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon on lines 32-38. We check that all the relevant data was successfully extracted from the file before setting the status.

Finally, we use a `while` loop to keep the program running and wait for the connection to be lost on line 41. You can modify this loop as needed to add additional functionality or exit conditions.
