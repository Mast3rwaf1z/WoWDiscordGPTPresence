write a python program using pypresence to read the data in /home/mast3r/Games/games/World\ of\ Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992\#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua to make a status on discord with the data
# Reply
Sure, here's an example Python program using the PyPresence library to read the data in the RichPresence.lua file and set a status on Discord:
```python
import os
import json
import time
from pypresence import Presence

# Path to the SavedVariables file for the RichPresence addon
saved_variables_path = '/home/mast3r/Games/games/World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua'

# Open the SavedVariables file and load the data into a dictionary
with open(saved_variables_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
    # Find the line starting with "MyAddonDB" and extract the JSON data
    start_index = data.index('{', data.index('MyAddonDB'))
    end_index = data.rindex('}') + 1
    json_data = data[start_index:end_index]
    rich_presence_data = json.loads(json_data)

# Initialize the PyPresence client with your application ID
client_id = 'your_application_id_here'
RPC = Presence(client_id)

# Connect to the Discord client
RPC.connect()

# Set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon
RPC.update(
    state='Playing World of Warcraft',
    details=f'Level {rich_presence_data["level"]} {rich_presence_data["class"]} in {rich_presence_data["zone"]}',
    large_image='wow_logo',
    large_text='World of Warcraft',
    small_image='character_icon',
    small_text=rich_presence_data['name']
)

# Wait for the program to end or for the connection to be lost
while True:
    time.sleep(15)
    if not RPC.connected:
        break
```
In this program, we first define the path to the RichPresence.lua SavedVariables file on line 6. We then use the `open()` function to read the file and extract the JSON data from the "MyAddonDB" table on lines 9-14.

Next, we initialize the PyPresence client with your Discord application ID on line 17, connect to the Discord client on line 20, and set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon on lines 23-29. You'll need to replace "your_application_id_here" with the actual ID for your Discord application.

Finally, we use a `while` loop to keep the program running and wait for the connection to be lost on line 32. You can modify this loop as needed to add additional functionality or exit conditions.
