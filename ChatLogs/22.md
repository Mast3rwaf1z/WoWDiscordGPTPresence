Sure! Here's an updated version of the README file:
# RichPresence Addon
The RichPresence addon is a World of Warcraft addon that gathers the current zone, character name, character class, and character level, and saves it in the SavedVariables file.

The saved data is then read by a Python program using the pypresence library, which sets up a rich presence on Discord. The rich presence displays the player's name, level, class, and current zone.
## File structure
```
