As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to write code for a specific programming language. However, I can provide you with the steps and logic to create such an addon in Lua, which is the language used for writing World of Warcraft addons.

To create an addon that gathers the current zone, character name, character class, and character level and saves it in the SavedVariables, you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a new addon by creating a new folder in the AddOns folder in your WoW directory. Name the folder something like "MyAddon".

2. Create a new file inside the "MyAddon" folder and name it "MyAddon.lua".

3. Open the "MyAddon.lua" file and add the following code:
```lua
local MyAddon = {}
local playerName = UnitName("player")
local playerClass, classId = UnitClass("player")
local playerLevel = UnitLevel("player")
local currentZone = GetRealZoneText()

function MyAddon:OnEvent(event, ...)
  if event == "PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD" then
    print("Current Zone: " .. currentZone)
    print("Player Name: " .. playerName)
    print("Player Class: " .. playerClass)
    print("Player Level: " .. playerLevel)
    
    -- Save variables
    MyAddonDB = MyAddonDB or {}
    MyAddonDB.zone = currentZone
    MyAddonDB.name = playerName
    MyAddonDB.class = playerClass
    MyAddonDB.level = playerLevel
  end
end

local frame = CreateFrame("Frame")
frame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD")
frame:SetScript("OnEvent", MyAddon.OnEvent)
```
1. Save the "MyAddon.lua" file and reload your UI.

2. When you log in to WoW, the addon will print your current zone, character name, class, and level in the chat window.

3. The addon also saves these variables in the "MyAddonDB" SavedVariable table.

4. You can access the saved variables by typing "/dump MyAddonDB" in the chat window.

Note: This is just an example of how you can create an addon that gathers and saves character information. You can customize the code to suit your specific needs. Also, make sure to test the addon thoroughly before using it in a live game environment.
