Sure, to add the event when the player changes zone to the if statement on line 8 in the Lua script, you can modify the code in the following way:
```lua
local MyAddon = {}
local playerName = UnitName("player")
local playerClass, classId = UnitClass("player")
local playerLevel = UnitLevel("player")
local currentZone = GetRealZoneText()

function MyAddon:OnEvent(event, ...)
  if event == "PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD" or event == "ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA" then
    currentZone = GetRealZoneText()
    print("Current Zone: " .. currentZone)
    print("Player Name: " .. playerName)
    print("Player Class: " .. playerClass)
    print("Player Level: " .. playerLevel)
    
    -- Save variables
    MyAddonDB = MyAddonDB or {}
    MyAddonDB.zone = currentZone
    MyAddonDB.name = playerName
    MyAddonDB.class = playerClass
    MyAddonDB.level = playerLevel
  end
end

local frame = CreateFrame("Frame")
frame:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD")
frame:RegisterEvent("ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA")
frame:SetScript("OnEvent", MyAddon.OnEvent)
```
In this modified code, we've added the "ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA" event to the if statement on line 8. This event will trigger whenever the player changes zones, whether by walking or using a teleport or flight path.

We've also added a line to update the "currentZone" variable whenever the zone changes. This ensures that the addon always displays the correct current zone in the chat window and saves the correct value to the SavedVariables.

Finally, we've registered the "ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA" event in the CreateFrame function on line 18 so that the addon will listen for this event in addition to the "PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD" event.
