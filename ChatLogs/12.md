no don't use exec, it doesn't work

You are correct that using exec to parse Lua code is generally not recommended due to security concerns. Here is a modified version of the code that uses the luaconf library to parse the Lua code instead:
```python
import os
import time
import json
import luaconf
from pypresence import Presence

# Path to the SavedVariables file for the RichPresence addon
saved_variables_path = '/home/mast3r/Games/games/World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/125579992#2/SavedVariables/RichPresence.lua'

# Read the data from the SavedVariables file
with open(saved_variables_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Remove any whitespace or comments from the Lua data
data = ''.join([line.strip() for line in data.split('\n') if not line.strip().startswith('--')])

# Parse the Lua data into a dictionary using the luaconf library
player_data = luaconf.parse(data)['MyAddonDB']

# Convert the dictionary to a JSON string
player_json = json.dumps(player_data)

# Load the player data from the JSON string
player_data = json.loads(player_json)

# Extract the relevant data from the player data dictionary
player_name = player_data['name']
player_class = player_data['class']
player_level = player_data['level']
current_zone = player_data['zone']

# Initialize the PyPresence client with your application ID
client_id = '1089858208954318858'
RPC = Presence(client_id)

# Connect to the Discord client
RPC.connect()

# Set the Discord status with data from the RichPresence addon
RPC.update(
    state='Playing World of Warcraft',
    details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
    large_image='wow_logo',
    large_text='World of Warcraft',
    small_image='character_icon',
    small_text=player_name
)

# Update the Discord status every 15 seconds
try:
    while True:
        time.sleep(15)
        RPC.update(
            state='Playing World of Warcraft',
            details=f'Level {player_level} {player_class} in {current_zone}',
            large_image='wow_logo',
            large_text='World of Warcraft',
            small_image='character_icon',
            small_text=player_name
        )
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass

# Disconnect from the Discord client
RPC.close()
```
On line 11, we use the `luaconf.parse()` function to parse the Lua code and convert it to a Python dictionary. The rest of the code is the same as in my previous response.
