On line 28, the `json.dumps()` function is used to convert the dictionary to a JSON-formatted string. On line 31, `json.loads()` is used to load the data from the JSON string into a new dictionary. The rest of the code remains the same as in my previous response.

Additionally, I have added the correct client ID for your application on line 37.
