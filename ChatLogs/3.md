where would SavedVariables be saved on the disk?

SavedVariables in World of Warcraft addons are saved on the disk in a file named "SavedVariables.lua" in the WTF (Warden Tracking File) folder, which is located in the WoW installation directory.

The path to the SavedVariables file is as follows:
```php
World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/<Your Account>/SavedVariables/<Addon Name>.lua
```
The `<Your Account>` folder is named after your WoW account and the `<Addon Name>` is the name of the addon for which the SavedVariables are being stored. The SavedVariables.lua file contains all the saved data for the addon, including any variables that are stored in the SavedVariables table.

Note that each WoW account has its own SavedVariables folder, and each character on the account has its own set of SavedVariables. Therefore, the SavedVariables for an addon will be unique to each character, unless the addon is specifically designed to share data across characters or accounts.

It's important to remember that SavedVariables can be accessed and modified by other addons or external programs if they have access to the file system. Therefore, it's generally not recommended to store sensitive information in SavedVariables without proper encryption or protection mechanisms.
