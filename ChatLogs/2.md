Sure, here's an example of a TOC file for the RichPresence addon:
```shell
## Interface: 90005
## Title: RichPresence
## Version: 10.0.7
## Author: Mast3r_waf1z and ChatGPT
## SavedVariables: MyAddonDB

MyAddon.lua
```
In this TOC file, we've included the name, version, author, and saved variables for the addon. The saved variables are defined as "MyAddonDB", which matches the name we used in the Lua file. The Lua file is included at the bottom of the TOC file and should have the same name as the Lua file we created earlier.

Make sure to save this TOC file in the same folder as the Lua file and reload your UI after making any changes to the addon files.
