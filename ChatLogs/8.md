replace '" ' with '",' on line 13

Sure, here's the updated line 13 with the replacement you suggested:
```python
player_data = [d.split('=')[1].replace('" ', '","') for d in data.splitlines() if 'MyAddonDB.' in d]
```
This will replace instances of `"` with `","` in each of the extracted data values, which should correctly split the data into separate strings.
